# Library App - Skill Factory React

## Team
- Adán Rodríguez
- Cecilia Kuckiewicz
- Gabriel Maguna
- Mariano Pérez

## Tasks
- You will need to create a new React project using the CRA CLI.
- The application must allow:
    - Add a book
    - Delete a book
    - Updating a book
    - Retrieve information from loaded books
- You will need Redux Toolkit for the state management of the application.
- This application will be the first one that, in a mandatory way, you will make with Responsive Design.
- You will be able to use the style libraries you like as well as all the libraries that you consider that add value to the product. to the product.
- For each book, maintain the consistency of the chosen language (ES/EN). 
(ES/EN) and must contain:
    - Title
    - Author(s) 
    - Year of publication
    - An image for the cover
    - A description or outline of the content
    - ISBN (If available) - Optional
- We are working with the best coding standards so we need everything to be written with the best so we need everything to be written with the implementations of ECMA6 and later of ECMA6 and later (functions, destructuring, among others).
- Design the mockup of the UI for Login & Register. Add these options to the options to the navbar or menu, depending on the style you choose.
- As an innovation, all teams will implement the SCRUM methodology.

Optionals

- Use a Call To Action that makes a request to an API and loads books in our books into our application.
- Ideally, it would be very optimal if the addition of books and the updating of books were updating of books should ideally be done in different routes.

## Commands

### Clone project with GitHub
 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/marianorp/TP4-SFReact-LibraryApp.git
```

### Project

In the project directory, you can execute:
### `npm install`

Installs all project dependencies.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
